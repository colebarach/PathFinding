# Pathfinding
Unity implementation of various path finding algorithms.
## A* Algorithm
Implementation of the A* algorithm through AStarLibrary.cs
- Intakes a 2D obstruction texture and generates a path from vector A to B.
- Obstruction Texture consists of white & black pixels. (walkable & unwalkable) Example given in /Textures
## To Do
- Implementation of more algorithms as necessary
- Implementation of AStarNavigator.cs
